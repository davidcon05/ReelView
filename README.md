# ReelView
Small project to review me and my wife's favorite Halloween movies. 
The purpose is to abstravt away all the things except for what I 
want to learn for Android development. In this case, I'm focusing 
on: TopAppBar, Navigation, displaying data. 

## To do
This app pulls data from [https://www.omdbapi.com/](https://www.omdbapi.com/). It would be nice to leverage
some of those API features.
- Pull live data from the API
- Use clicking on a card to give give live details
- Participate in their like feature using a swipe

This would help learn lessons in moshi and retrofit
- Using Koin or Hilt might be a bit much for such a simple app
